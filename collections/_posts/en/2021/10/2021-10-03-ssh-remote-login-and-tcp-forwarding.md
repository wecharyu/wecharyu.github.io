**Security Shell Protocal** (SSH) is a network protocol, intended to provide secure encrypted communicatons over an insecure network.
SSH application are based on a client/server architecture, SSH client is used to log into a remote machine (SSH Server) and execute commands on a remote machine.
The most common usages include:
- SSH Remote login
- Arbitrary TCP ports forwarding

## SSH Remote Login
There are many methods for authentication, most common methods are password authentication and public key authentication.
ssh will store host identifications in `~/.ssh/known_hosts` file when logging in to a remote ssh server for the first,
which means it will save information for each host it has ever visited.

### Password Authentication
If you do not config any authentication methods, the ssh will prompts you for a password.

```bash
$ ssh username@ip
username@ipâ€˜s password:
```

The default port of SSH service is **22**, if the ssh service is not started on the default port, you need to specify the port with `-p` option:
```bash
$ ssh -p 1234 username@ip
```

If a host's identification changes, ssh will warn for this and disable the password authentication to prevent server spoofing or man-in-the-middle attacks,
which could otherwise be used to circumvent the encryption.

### Public Key Authentication
Public key authentication is based on public-key cryptography, using cryptosystems where encryption and decription are done with separate keys.
Using public key authentication can avoid entering password everytime you log in, you should generate a public-private key pair on the client,
and copy the public key to remote server, then you can log in remote server conveniently.

#### Generate Key Pair
There are many public-key protocols and algorithms, here we use `RSA algorithm`, type command in client machine:
```bash
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
```
This command will generate `~/.ssh/` directory, and `~/.ssh/id_rsa` file generated represents private key, `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` represents public key.
#### Copy Public Key to Server
Server machine should store public key of client in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file, there are two methods to copy public key:
1. Use `ssh-copy-id` command in client:
```bash
$ ssh-copy-id remote_username@ip
```
2. Write `id_rsa.pub` of client to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` of server directly:
```bash
(client) $ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
(server) $ vim ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

#### Login with Client
Now you can log into remote server like [Password Authentication](#password-authentication), but no need to enter password anymore.

To simplify the command, you can also create `~/.ssh/config` file and add `Host`:
```bash
Host wechar
  HostName <remote_ip>
  User wechar
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```
Then you can login with just:
```bash
$ ssh wechar
```
For the further step, if you have to access the devices in a separate security ozone through **jump server**, you can config like:
```bash
Host jump
  HostName <jump_ip>
  User username
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Host dev01 # must access through jump server, access dev01 as username
  HostName <dev01_ip>
  ProxyJump jump
  ProxyCommand  sudo ssh -W %h:%p jump

Host dev02 # access dev02 as another_user
  HostName <dev02_ip>
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  User another_user
  ProxyCommand ssh -W %h:%p jump
```

## TCP Forwarding
Forwarding of arbitry TCP connections over a secure channel can be specified with option:
```bash
-L [bind_address:]port:target_host:target_hostport
```
This will allocate a socket to listen to the target socket, once a connection is made to local port, the connection is forwarded over the secure channel.

Take an example, we forward `10.128.1.1:4990` to local port of `5900` through jump server `jump`:
```bash
$ ssh -f -N -L 5900:10.128.1.1:4990 jump
```

- `-f` option: Backgrounds ssh
- `-N` option: Do not execute a remote command, just forwarding ports

There are many application of TCP forwarding.

### JVM Remote Debug
We can use TCP forwarding to debug for java application in remote server, steps like this:
1. start java application with options:
```bash
java -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=4990 -cp "Test.jar:lib/*" org.wechar.Main
```
2. config remote debugger in Idea:

Then you can debug remote java application just like local application.
